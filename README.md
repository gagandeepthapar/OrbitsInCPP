# OrbitsInCPP
Practicing C++ by implementing Orbital Mechanics and plotting ability

## Different Parts to the Project

* Custom 4th order Runge-Kutta initial value solver (to propagate orbit from initial state vector)
* Plotting ability with MatPlotLib CPP library
* Custom classes and structs to contain similar information (e.g., Orbital Elements, State Vector, Solver, etc.)
